of hardware. For a certain function, it can be implemented in software or hardware, which is called software and hardware is logically equivalent. When designing a computer system, the functions of software and hardware should be assigned. Generally speaking, if a function is frequently used and the cost of implementing it with hardware is ideal, hardware should be used to implement it, because the efficiency of hardware implementation is generally higher.</p><span id="more"></span><h1 id="Computer-hardware"><a href="#Computer-hardware" class="headerlink" title="Computer hardware"></a>Computer hardware</h1><h2 id="Basic-ideas-of-von-neumann"><a href="#Basic-ideas-of-von-neumann" class="headerlink" title="Basic ideas of von neumann"></a>Basic ideas of von neumann</h2><p>When von Neumann studied EDVAC, he proposed the concept of “stored program”. The idea of “stored program” laid the basic structure of modern operating systems, and all kinds of computers based on this concept are collectively referred to as von Neumann machines. Its characteristics are as follows:</p><ul><li>Adopt the working method of “stored program”.</li><li>The computer hardware system consists of five components: arithmetic unit, controller, memory, input device and output device.<br>Instructions and data are stored in memory in the same position, with no difference in form, while computers can distinguish them by relying on different stages of the instruction cycle.</li><li>Instructions and data are represented in binary. Instructions consist of operation codes and address codes. The operation code indicates the type of operation, and the address code indicates the address of the operand.</li></ul><p>The basic idea of “stored program” is that the pre-prepared program and the original data source can be sent to main memory before execution. Once the program is started and executed, there is no need for operator intervention.</p><p>Its basic working mode is: control flow driven mode.</p><h2 id="Functional-components-of-a-computer"><a href="#Functional-components-of-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Functional components of a computer"></a>Functional components of a computer</h2><h3 id="Input-device"><a href="#Input-device" class="headerlink" title="Input device"></a>Input device</h3><p>The main function of an input device is to input programs and data into a computer in the form of information that the machine can recognize and accept. The most commonly used and basic input device is the keyboard.</p><h3 id="Output-device"><a href="#Output-device" class="headerlink" title="Output device"></a>Output device</h3><p>The main task of an output device is to output the results of computer processing in a form acceptable to people or in the form of information required by other systems. The most common and commonly used output devices are monitors, printers, etc.</p><h3 id="Storage"><a href="#Storage" class="headerlink" title="Storage"></a>Storage</h3><p>Memory is divided into main memory (also known as internal memory) and auxiliary memory (also known as external memory). The memory that the CPU can directly access is main memory. Secondary memory is used to help main memory remember more information. Information in secondary memory must be transferred to main memory before it can be accessed by the CPU.</p><p>The working mode of main memory is to access the address of the storage unit, which is called address access.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvtfhjxi4/image/upload/v1645864310/origin-of-ray/Flowchart_xh7xl0.jpg" alt="img"><br>The most basic composition of main memory is shown in the figure.</p><p>The memory stores binary data, the address register (MAR) stores the memory access address, and finds the corresponding memory cell after address decoding.</p><p>The Data Register (MDR) is used to temporarily store information to be read or written from memory.</p><p>The timing control logic is used to produce various timing signals required for memory operation.</p><p>A memory bank consists of many storage units, each storage unit contains several storage elements, and each storage element stores one bit of binary code. Therefore, the storage unit can store a string of binary code, which is called a storage word. The storage length of this string of code is the storage word length, which needs to be an integer multiple of 1B (8bits).</p><p>What we usually call a 32-bit machine refers to the word length, also known as the machine word length. The so-called word length usually refers to the width of the data path used for integer operations inside the CPU, that is, the number of bits of binary data that can be processed by a computer for an integer operation (that is, fixed-point integer operation, this concept will be discussed later in the chapter), usually related to the number of registers and adders of the CPU. Therefore, the word length is generally equal to the size of the internal register. The longer the word length, the larger the data representation range and the higher the calculation accuracy.</p><p>The concept of word length is different from that of word. A word is used to represent the unit of information to be processed and is used to measure the width of a data type. For example, x86 defines a word as 16 bits.</p><p>Instruction word length: The number of bits of binary code contained in an instruction word.</p><p>Storage word length: The number of bits of binary code stored in a storage unit.</p><p>They must all be integer multiples of bytes.</p><p>The instruction word usually takes an integer multiple of the storage word length. If the instruction word length is equal to 2 times the storage word length, two memory access cycles are required to retrieve an instruction. If the instruction word length is equal to the storage word length, the instruction fetch cycle is equal to the machine cycle.</p><p>MAR for addressing, the number of bits corresponding to the number of memory cells, such as MAR bit 10, there are 2 ^ 10 = 1024 memory cells, that is, 1k, the information that can be stored is 1k * storage word length.</p><p>The virtual address should not be considered here, and the physical address that goes to the MAR is already converted.</p><p>The length of the MAR is the same as the length of the PC, and both are used to store addresses. It’s just that the content in the memory pointed to by the address stored by the PC must be an instruction.</p><p>The length of MDR is equal to the storage word length, usually an integer multiple of the second power of the byte. Because the role of MDR is to temporarily store the content to be read or written from memory, in general, the length of each read and write from memory is one storage word length.</p><p>So <em>should the constant of the data bus be the same as the length of the MDR?</em></p><p>Note that although MAR and MDR are part of the memory, modern computers generally incorporate them into the CPU.</p><h3 id="Arithmetic-unit"><a href="#Arithmetic-unit" class="headerlink" title="Arithmetic unit"></a>Arithmetic unit</h3><p>An arithmetic unit is an executive part of a computer that performs arithmetic and logical operations.</p><p>The core of the arithmetic unit is the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU).

Therefore, the function of a machine instruction is realized by a sequence composed of several microinstructions. In short, the operation completed by a machine instruction is divided into several microinstructions to complete, which are interpreted and executed by microinstructions.</p><p>From the one-to-one correspondence between instructions and microinstructions, programs and microprograms, and addresses and microaddresses, the former is related to internal memory, while the latter is related to control memory (which is a part of the microprogram controller. The microprogram controller is mainly composed of three parts: control memory, microinstruction register and address transfer logic. Among them, the microinstruction register is further divided into two parts: the microaddress register and the microcommand register), and there are corresponding hard devices related to this.</p><p>It can be seen from the flowchart of microprogram execution of general instructions. Each CPU cycle is for one microinstruction. This tells us how to design microprograms, and will also allow us to further experience the relationship between machine instructions and microinstructions.</p><p>Level 2 is the traditional machine language layer, which is also an actual machine layer with microprograms interpreting machine instruction systems.</p><ul><li>Level 3 is the operating system layer, which is implemented by operating system programs, which are composed of machine instructions and generalized instructions. These generalized instructions are software instructions defined and interpreted by the operating system for the purpose of extending machine functions, so this layer is also called the hybrid layer.</li></ul><p>The specific content of generalized instructions can be delved into when looking at the operating system.</p><ul><li>The fourth layer is the assembly language layer, which provides users with a symbolic language through which assembly language programs can be written. This layer is supported and executed by the assembly program.</li><li>Level 5 is the high-level language layer, which is user-oriented and set up for the convenience of users writing applications. This layer has support and execution of high-level program compilers.</li></ul><p>Above the high-level language layer, there can also be an application layer.</p><p>Your pure hardware system without soft armor is called bare metal. Layers 3-5 are called virtual machines, which are simply software-implemented machines.</p><p>The relationship between the layers is close, the lower layer is the foundation of the upper layer, and the upper layer is the extension of the lower layer.</p><h1 id="The-working-principle-of-computer-system"><a href="#The-working-principle-of-computer-system" class="headerlink" title="The working principle of computer system"></a>The working principle of computer system</h1><h2 id="How-“stored-program”-works"><a href="#How-“stored-program”-works" class="headerlink" title="How “stored program” works"></a>How “stored program” works</h2><p>This method stipulates that before the program is executed, the instructions or data contained in the program need to be sent to main memory. Once the program is started and executed, there is no need for operator intervention, and the extraction and execution tasks of the instructions are automatically completed one by one.</p><p>The execution process of each instruction includes: accessing the instruction from the main, decoding the instruction, calculating the address of the next instruction, taking the operand and executing it, and sending the execution result back to memory.</p><p>The instructions here are the machine instructions mentioned above.

After receiving Enter, the shell calls up the kernel program of the system, and the kernel loads the executable file hello on the disk to the main memory (corresponding to 3). The kernel loads the code and data in the executable file (here is the string “hello, world! \ N “), the address of the first instruction of hello is sent to the PC, and the CPU then starts executing the hello program, which accesses each character in the string loaded into the main memory from the main memory to the CPU’s register (corresponding to 4), and then sends the characters in the CPU register to the display (corresponding to 5).</p><blockquote><p>It is not so simple to send it directly to the PC here, it will involve the switching of processes.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Description-of-the-instruction-execution-process"><a href="#Description-of-the-instruction-execution-process" class="headerlink" title="Description of the instruction execution process"></a>Description of the instruction execution process</h2><p>The code segment of the executable file is composed of a sequence of machine instructions represented by 0 and 1, which are used to indicate that the CPU completes a specific atomic operation.</p><p>For example, the number fetch instruction takes out a data from the storage unit and sends it to the register of the CPU.
