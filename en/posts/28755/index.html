What is a file system?</li><li>What functions does the file system need to complete?</li></ul><p>Pay attention to distinguish the logical structure and physical structure of the file, do not confuse the two.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Document-concept"><a href="#Document-concept" class="headerlink" title="Document concept"></a>Document concept</h2><h3 id="Definition-of-document"><a href="#Definition-of-document" class="headerlink" title="Definition of document"></a>Definition of document</h3><p>File is an important concept in the operating system. A file is a collection of information stored on a computer based on a computer hard disk. The file can be a text document, a picture, a program, etc.</p><p>When the system is running, the computer schedules and allocates resources based on the process; while in the input and output of the user, the file is the basic unit</p><p>The input of most applications is achieved through files, and their output is also saved in files for long-term storage of information and future access. When users use files for input and output of applications, they also hope to access files, modify files, save files, etc., to achieve maintenance and management of files. This requires the system to provide a file management system. The file system in the operating system is used to achieve these management requirements of users.</p><p>To clearly understand the concept of a document, it is necessary to understand what exactly a document consists of:</p><p>First of all, there is a piece of storage space, more precisely, the data in the storage space.</p><ul><li>Secondly, since the operating system has to manage thousands of data, it must be divided into these data for classification and indexing, so the file must contain classification and indexing information.</li><li>Finally, different users have different access rights to the data, so the file must contain some information about access rights.</li></ul><p>Users create files through the file system, provide input and output of the application, and manage resources. First, understand the structure of the file, and we define it by bottom-up approach:</p><ol><li>Data items. Data items are the lowest level of data organization in a file system and can be divided into two types:<ol><li>Basic data item. A value used to describe a certain attribute of an object, such as name, date, or document number, is the smallest logical data unit that can be named in the data, that is, atomic data.</li><li>Combination of data items. Consists of multiple basic data items.</li></ol></li><li>Record. A record is a collection of related data items used to describe the properties of an object in a certain aspect, such as a candidate’s registration record, including a candidate’s name, date of birth, school code, ID number and other fields.</li><li>File. A file is a collection of related information defined by the creator, which can be logically divided into structured files and unstructured files</li></ol><h3 id="Properties-of-the-file"><a href="#Properties-of-the-file" class="headerlink" title="Properties of the file"></a>Properties of the file</h3><p>Files have certain attributes, which vary from system to system, but usually include the following attributes:</p><ol><li> <strong>Name</strong> . The file name is unique and saved in an easy-to-read form.</li><li>Identifier. A unique label, usually a number, that identifies a file within a file system, an internal name that is unreadable to humans.</li><li> <strong>Type</strong> . Used by different types of file systems.</li><li> <strong>Location</strong> . Refers to the device and the pointer to the file on the device.</li><li> <strong>Size</strong> . The current size of the file (expressed in bytes, words, or blocks), which can also include the maximum allowed for the file.</li><li> <strong>Protection</strong> . Access control information that protects files.</li><li> <strong>Time</strong> , date and user ID. Information about file creation, last modification and last access, used to protect and track file usage.</li></ol><p>All file information is saved in the directory structure, and the directory structure is saved on external storage.</p><p>File information is only brought into memory on request. Typically, directory entries include the file name and its unique identifier, which locates information about other attributes.</p><h3 id="Basic-operation-of-file"><a href="#Basic-operation-of-file" class="headerlink" title="Basic operation of file"></a>Basic operation of file</h3><p>Files belong to abstract data types. In order to properly define files, operations related to them need to be considered. The operating system provides system calls that perform operations such as creating, writing, reading, relocating, deleting, and truncating files.</p><ol><li>Create a file. There are two necessary steps to create a file: one is to find space for the file in the file system, and the other is to create an entry for the new file in the directory, which records the file name, location in the file system, and possibly other information.</li><li>Write to a file. To write to a file, execute a system call specifying the file name and the contents to be written to the file. For a given file name, the system searches the directory for the file location. The system must maintain a pointer to the write location for the file (is it saved for every process that writes to the file?) so that whenever a write operation occurs, the write pointer is updated.</li><li>Read the file. In order to read the file, execute a system call specifying the file name and the memory location of the file block to be read into. It is also necessary to search the directory to find the relevant directory entry, and the system maintains a pointer to the read location. Whenever a read operation occurs, update the read pointer. A process usually only reads or writes to one file, so the current operation location can be used as a pointer to the current file location of each process, that is, the read and write pointers can be the same for the same process.</li><li>File relocation (file addressing). Search the directory according to a certain condition, set the current file location to a given value, and do not read or write files.</li><li>Delete files. First find the directory entry of the file to be deleted from the directory, make it an empty entry, and then reclaim the storage space occupied by the file.</li><li>Truncate the file. Allow all attributes of the file to remain unchanged, and delete the content of the file, that is, set its length to 0.</li></ol><p>These six basic operations can be combined to perform other file operations, such as copying a file, creating a new file, then reading from the old file and writing to the new file.</p><p>The following can be combined here<a target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://x8pzubgmif.feishu.cn/docs/doccnMHzzJ6XDE4h0FXVc38OsVX#8ACKZj">目录结构的所需要操作</a>Understand the operation of the file system as a whole</p><h3 id="Opening-and-closing-of-files"><a href="#Opening-and-closing-of-files" class="headerlink" title="Opening and closing of files"></a>Opening and closing of files</h3><p>Because many file operations involve searching for the relevant directory entry for a given file, many systems require that the attributes of the specified file (including the physical location of the file on external memory) be copied from external memory to external memory using the system call open on the first use of the file. In the entry of an open file table in memory, the entry number (also called index) of the table is returned to the user.</p><p>The operating system maintains a table of information about all open files (open-file table).</p><p>When a user needs to operate a file, the index can be found directly from the Open File table, saving the search process.</p><p>Most operating systems require files to be explicitly opened before use</p><p>The operation open searches the directory based on the file name and copies the directory entry to the Open Files table.</p><p>If the open request is allowed, the process can open the file, and open usually returns a pointer to an entry in the open file table.</p><p>I/O operations are performed by using the pointer instead of the file name.</p><p>The open instruction searches for the directory through the file name. After finding the corresponding directory entry, it returns the index to the process and stores it in the open file table. After opening, the operating system no longer uses the file name to operate.</p><p>The entire system table contains process-related information, such as file location on disk, access date, and size.</p><p>The first time a file is opened by a process, the system open table will increase an entry, when another process performs open, is to increase an entry in its own process open table, and then point to the corresponding entry of the system open table, At the same time, the counter in the corresponding entry of the system open table is incremented by one to indicate how many processes have opened the file.</p><p>Each close operation will deduct the counter by one. When the counter is 0, it means that the file is no longer in use. The system will recover the memory resources allocated to the file. If the file has been modified, the file will be written back to external memory (this step is a bit similar to missing page replacement. If the modification bit is 1, the page content needs to be written back to the hard disk), and the corresponding entry in the system open table is deleted, and finally the file control block (File Control Block, FCB) is released.</p><p>What are the similarities and differences between FCB, directory entry, and system open table entry?</p><p>Each open file has the following associated information:</p><ul><li> <strong>File pointer.</strong> The system tracks the last read and write location as a pointer to the current file location. This pointer is unique to a process that opens the file, that is, it is process-level, so it must be stored separately from the properties of the disk file itself.</li><li> <strong>File open count</strong> . When a file is closed, the operating system must reuse its open file table entry, otherwise the space in the table will gradually shrink. And because multiple processes may open the same file, the system must wait for the last process to close the file before deleting the open file entry. It is achieved through the counter. When the count is 0, close the file and delete the entry. This is file-level.</li><li> <strong>File disk location</strong> . Most file operations require the system to modify file data. This information is stored in memory.</li></ul><p>This thing should be in the system open table, but another question, if it is a continuous file storage, in the process of writing, the file size exceeded, what will happen?</p><p>Is it to reapply for disk space, then copy it and modify the location? Or do you not allow writing more than the file size.</p><ul><li> <strong>Access permissions</strong> . Each process needs an access mode (create/read-only/read-write/add, etc.). This information is process-level, so it should be stored in the process open table.</li></ul><h2 id="Logical-structure-of-the-file-internal-logical-structure-of-the-file"><a href="#Logical-structure-of-the-file-internal-logical-structure-of-the-file" class="headerlink" title="Logical structure of the file (internal logical structure of the file)"></a>Logical structure of the file (internal logical structure of the file)</h2><p>The logical structure of the file is the organization of the file as seen from the user’s point of view.</p><p>The physical structure of the file is the storage organization form of the file stored in the external memory from the perspective of implementation.</p><p>The logical structure of the file has nothing to do with the nature of the storage medium, but the physical structure of the file has a great relationship with the characteristics of the storage medium.</p><p>This is like a linked list in a data structure, which can be either sequential or chained storage</p><p>Unable to paste block outside Docs</p><h3 id="Unstructured-file"><a href="#Unstructured-file" class="headerlink" title="Unstructured file"></a>Unstructured file</h3><p>The simplest form of file organization organizes and accumulates data in order between cities.

The definition of sequential files is to organize records in order, and the definition of index files is to organize by index. It is the difference between the two.</p><p>However, for variable length record file, to find the i-th record, we must sequentially find the first data i-1, so as to obtain the length L of the corresponding data, and then continuously add to obtain the first address of the i-th record.</p><p>Variable-length record files can only be searched in order, and the system overhead is large, so an index table can be established to speed up the retrieval speed.

When deleting a file, first find the FCB, reclaim the file space, and then clean up the directory entry.</p><p>The single-level directory structure realizes “access by name”, but there are disadvantages such as slow search speed, file duplicate names are not allowed, and it is not convenient for file sharing, and it is obviously not applicable to multi-user operating systems.</p><h5 id="Two-level-directory-structure"><a href="#Two-level-directory-structure" class="headerlink" title="Two-level directory structure"></a>Two-level directory structure</h5><p>The file directory is divided into two levels: Master File Directory (MFD) and User File Directory (UFD).</p><p>The main file directory entry records the user name and the location of the corresponding user file directory.</p><p>The user file directory entry records the FCB information of the user file.</p><p>When a user wants to access a file, only the UFD corresponding to the user is searched.</p><p>This not only solves the problem of duplicate names of different user files, but also ensures the security of files to a certain extent.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvtfhjxi4/image/upload/v1640565265/origin-of-ray/asynccode_jo7gur.png" alt="img"></p><h5 id="Multi-level-directory-structure-tree-directory-structure"><a href="#Multi-level-directory-structure-tree-directory-structure" class="headerlink" title="Multi-level directory structure (tree directory structure)"></a>Multi-level directory structure (tree directory structure)</h5><p>This is the most familiar directory structure, with absolute paths, relative paths, working directory (current directory), and all directory names and file names separated by “/“.</p><p>The book says that when searching for a file in the tree directory, you need to access the intermediate nodes step by step according to the path name, which increases the number of disk visits and affects the query speed, but the personal feeling is still faster than the above two.</p><h5 id="Acyclic-directory-structure"><a href="#Acyclic-directory-structure" class="headerlink" title="Acyclic directory structure"></a>Acyclic directory structure</h5><p>The tree structure facilitates file classification, but is not conducive to file sharing.</p><p>To this end, some directed edges pointing to the same node are added on the basis of the tree directory structure, making the entire directory a Directed Acyclic Graph.</p><p>Here you can look back at the data structure and algorithm, how to determine whether a graph is a directed acyclic graph, an undirected acyclic graph.</p><p>The algorithms of the two are not exactly the same.

The index node directly points to the file. Can the directory be shared in this way?</p><p>The essence of this question is, can an inode point to a directory? Further speaking, can FCB point to a directory?</p><p>In this sharing method, information such as the physical address of the file and other file attributes is no longer placed in the directory entry, but in the index node. Only the file name and pointer to the corresponding index node are set in the file directory.</p><p>There should also be a counter in the index node to indicate the number of user directory entries linked to this index node (i.e. file).</p><p>When a user deletes a file, it cannot be deleted directly, but it is necessary to look at the counter.

Connect.</p><p>The new file only contains the pathname of the original file F. Such a linking method is called a symbolic link.</p><p>The pathname in the new file is only regarded as a symbol chain. When user B wants to access the linked file F and is about to read a new file of the LINK class, the operating system reads the file according to the pathname of the new file, so as to realize the user B’s relationship with the new file. Sharing of file F.</p><p>Only the owner of the file has a pointer to its inode, and other users sharing the file only have the path name of the file, so there is no problem of deleting a shared file and leaving a dangling pointer (this problem is a hard link problem).</p><p>When the owner of the file deletes a shared file, when other users access the file through the symbol chain, access failure will occur. At this time, the symbol chain will be deleted, and it will not have any impact at this time.</p><p>However, there is still a problem with using this method. After a file is shared through a symbolic link, the owner of the file deletes it, and other users who share the file before using the symbol chain to access the file, someone has created a file with the same name under the same path. If the file is still valid, but the point is no longer the original file.</p><p>The disadvantage of the soft chain method is that it is necessary to search the directory one by one according to the file path name until the index node of the file is found. Each access may have to read the disk multiple times, which increases the cost of accessing files and increases the frequency of starting the disk.</p><p>The advantage is that network sharing only needs to provide the network address and file path of the machine where the file is located.</p><h3 id="Common-issues"><a href="#Common-issues" class="headerlink" title="Common issues"></a>Common issues</h3><p>Both of these linking methods have a common problem, that is, each shared file has several file names.</p><p>That is to say, every time a link is added, a file name is added. Essentially, each user uses their own pathname to access the shared file, so when we try to traverse the entire file system, we will find the shared file multiple times.</p><p>Both links are static sharing methods, and there are additional sharing requirements in the file system, that is, two processes operate on a file at the same time, which is called dynamic sharing.</p><p>In other words, this way of static sharing only solves how different users access the same file, but it still cannot be accessed at the same time, and access at the same time belongs to dynamic sharing.</p><h2 id="File-protection"><a href="#File-protection" class="headerlink" title="File protection"></a>File protection</h2><h3 id="Access-type"><a href="#Access-type" class="headerlink" title="Access type"></a>Access type</h3><p>The protection of files is to control the access rights of files.

The most common way to achieve identity-based access is to add an Access-Control List (ACL) for each file and directory, which specifies each User name and allowed access rights.</p><p>The advantage of this method is that complex access methods can be used, while the disadvantage is that the length is unpredictable and may lead to complex space management.</p><p>The streamlined access list adopts owner, group, and other three types of user types.</p><ul><li>Owner.

The system also lists the name of the file owner when creating a file, and the group name he belongs to is listed in the FCB of the file.</p><p>When a user accesses a file, the file is accessed according to the permissions owned by the owner. If the user and the owner are in the same user group, they will be accessed according to the same group permissions, otherwise they can only be accessed according to other user permissions.
