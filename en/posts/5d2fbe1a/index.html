- The so-called relying mechanism is to design a set of programs to specifically respond to the problems that arise in a certain scenario, and use this set of programs to guide employees to do this kind of work
- If the original intention is talent development, then it is reasonable to go and bring employees along to develop the ladder. But if the original intention is to reduce the burden of managers, that instead should rely on the mechanism.

  - The problem of talking about implementation in isolation from the goal

    - Incentive failure

      - Work repeatedly switched, the previous discussion evaluation design development have become a sunk cost
      - Time is getting tighter and the challenge is getting bigger
