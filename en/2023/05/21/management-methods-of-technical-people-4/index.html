understanding of information, generally measured in breadth and depth</p></li><li><p>Skills</p><p>The skill and ability to perform and perform a job, generally measured by proficiency</p></li><li><p>Talent</p><ul><li>Spontaneous high-frequency patterns of thought, action, and feeling, including character traits, etc</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Three dimensions of work ability</p><ul><li><p>Professional competence</p><ul><li><p>For technical people, it generally refers to technical ability, which is different for different teams. Can be measured in breadth and depth</p><p>Breadth: Represents how large-scale things can be done<br> Depth: Represents how complex things can be done</p></li></ul></li><li><p>General ability</p><p>Such as: structured thinking ability. Teamwork ability. Project management ability. Quick learning ability</p></li><li><p>Personality strength</p><p>Personality strength usually refers to a person’s stable attitude and performance in the face of a certain situation, such as facing difficulties, perseverance, and positivity.<br> These personality forces are sometimes crucial to the ability to get something done, but they are not cultivated overnight. They often come from everyone’s long-term life and work experience, and once formed, they are difficult to change.<br> But hard to change doesn’t mean it can’t be changed. In order for team members to tend to a certain common temperament, managers need to unequivocally advocate the character that the team promotes.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Objectives of capacity building</p><p>It is best to focus on learning goals, rather than scattered knowledge points</p><ul><li><p>For example</p><ul><li><p>Professional competence perspective</p><p>Prior Art Series<br> Core technology thematic learning:<br> Architecture topics<br> Storage topics<br> Front-end topics<br> Security topics<br> Operation and maintenance topics<br> Automated Testing Topics<br> Expand new technologies<br> New technologies needed for business development<br> Technology in the field</p></li><li><p>General ability perspective</p><p>Project management capabilities<br> The ability to bring people<br> Communication skills</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Standards for capacity building</p><p>What is the original intention of improving employee capabilities? Different original intentions decide what standards to develop, and then write this standard into the employee’s personal development plan and agree with them</p><ul><li>Avoid unclear expectations leading to high expectations or poor results</li><li>Reasonably arrange the energy input of managers, and reasonably allocate the energy invested in different training objects</li></ul></li><li><p>Methods of capacity building</p><p>7% rely on work practice, 2% rely on mutual communication, and 1% rely on listening to lectures and reading books for self-study</p></li><li><p>Employee Willingness to Learn</p><p>How to stimulate the motivation and willingness of employees to learn?</p><ul><li><p>Push: give pressure, push him to learn</p><p>Provide clear job requirements</p><ul><li>Establish learning mechanisms. Such as mandatory compliance with learning rules and completion of learning tasks</li></ul></li><li><p>Pull: Give direction and guide him to learn</p><ul><li>Set an example</li><li>Equipped with tutors</li><li>Develop a skills map for the team to grow</li></ul></li><li><p>Let go: give room to play and learn independently</p><ul><li>Give employees the opportunity to shoulder heavy responsibilities<br> Give employees space to think independently</li><li>Give him confidence and patience, allow him to make mistakes and take detours</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Two beliefs in ability development</p><ul><li><p>Believe in the diversity of employees’ abilities, that is, see the differences and value the richness</p><p>In the era of knowledge economy, the creativity of employees can bring greater value to the team, and creativity often comes from the collision of differences</p></li><li><p>Believe in the system of team capabilities, that is, appreciate differences and value complementarities</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Motivation</p><p>Individual combat effectiveness depends on two elements: individual ability and willingness to use ability</p><ul><li><p>The challenge of employee motivation</p><p>Upward communication, employee motivation and team cohesion are the three most challenging management themes in managers minds</p><ul><li><p>Incentive cognitive non-system</p><p>Understand some motivation skills and methods, but do not understand the overall picture of motivation, nor the reasons behind it, so there is no systematic incentive plan</p></li><li><p>Lack of incentives</p><p>Real material incentives are not controlled by managers, and the spirit of “painting a pie” motivates employees without buying it, so there are few incentives available</p></li><li><p>Incentives don’t get the point</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</p><p>Does this theory apply to China? Is there anything that needs to be changed according to local conditions?</p><p>Three Stages of Employee Motivation Development</p><ul><li><p>Instinct</p><p>Mainly derived from the desire for survival and security, the hierarchy of needs is at the bottom of the “Maslow Hierarchy of Needs Model”.</p></li><li><p>Outside drive</p><p>The underlying philosophy is “seek reward, avoid punishment” - carrots and sticks - a widely accepted form of motivation in the industrial age for nearly 200 years. Its central purpose is to make employees “obey”.<br> At the same time, Taylor’s “scientific management theory” believed that workers were like parts in a machine, they just needed to do the right thing in the right way at the right time to ensure that the machine worked well. In the industrial age of assembly lines, workers were required to do “obedience” rather than ingenuity</p><ul><li><p>Existing problems</p><ul><li><p>For most managers, material incentives are beyond the control of managers except for the pie</p></li><li><p>Lead to the disappearance of intrinsic motivation and reduce employee self-motivation</p></li><li><p>Causing a decline in performance</p></li><li><p>Kill creativity</p></li><li><p>Suppress good deeds</p><p>For example, when a team’s rewards for excellence are not obvious, but the penalties for mistakes are severe</p></li><li><p>Encouraging fraud, shortcuts, unethical tactics</p></li><li><p>Addictive, making employees addicted to external incentives</p></li><li><p>Breeds short-sighted thinking</p></li><li><p>Will gradually be immune, “Those who are good at using authority will not be easily angry, and those who are good at using grace will not give indiscriminately”</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Non-material incentives</p><p>Such as praise and positive feedback, the negative harm of external incentives is low, and it is a commonly used external means</p><ul><li><p>Specific principle: the content of praise should be specific</p></li><li><p>Disclosure principle: public recognition</p><ul><li>Give praised employees more incentive</li><li>Tell everyone in the team what behaviors and values the team agrees with and advocates</li></ul></li><li><p>Timely principle</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Inside drive</p><ul><li><p>Three aspects of internal drive</p><ul><li>Take control of your own life, i.e. “autonomy”</li><li>Extend your abilities, i.e. “specialization”</li><li>Make life more meaningful, i.e. “purpose”</li></ul></li><li><p>Using internal drive to motivate employees is an unavoidable choice</p><ul><li><p>Choice of times</p><p>In the era of knowledge economy, the creativity of employees can create more value for the company, and creativity requires autonomy and difference, which is almost the opposite of the concept of the industrial age.</p></li><li><p>People’s choice</p><p>With the development of China’s economy and culture, material rewards and punishments and the evaluation of others have become less important than before. Many professionals have their own unique work values, especially whether they are willing to do it</p></li></ul></li><li><p>How to excite</p><ul><li><p>Increases employee autonomy, that is, gives employees a certain degree of autonomy and control</p><ul><li><p>The first is the freedom to work when and where</p></li><li><p>Secondly, the degree of freedom of work content</p><p>Employees can choose their own work content to a certain extent</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Improve the precision of employees, so that employees continue to grow</p><p>Specialization here does not emphasize setting goals to become an expert, but emphasizes the process of self-involvement, creating conditions for employees to be willing to self-invest</p><ul><li><p>Clear work objectives</p><p>The clearer the requirements for the employee, the more willing he is to put in the effort</p></li><li><p>The goal should be slightly challenging</p><p>Demanding too much from employees can lead to anxiety, and too little can lead to boredom</p></li><li><p>To be able to use its advantages</p><p>Everyone is willing to do what they are good at, and if a job can give full play to the unique advantages of employees, employees will definitely be enthusiastic.<br> Advantages can have many levels, we may not be able to meet the work content expected by an employee, but we can also consider the behavior mode and thinking mode, such as letting it do some communication</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Improve the sense of meaning and mission of work</p><p>While not rejecting benefits, pursue maximizing “value” and hope that the work you do is meaningful and valuable<br> There is always a group of people who leave because their work is worthless. They are not hypocritical, but really need their work to be valuable</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Employee happiness</p><p>Total Sustainable Well-being (PERMA)</p><p>Not just emotional happiness, but a flourishing state of life that Martin Seligman calls “blooming.”</p><ul><li><p>Positive emotions</p><p>What kind of team atmosphere are you creating?

  - Evaluate the level of collaboration and identify work priorities

    For the level of collaboration, it is difficult for us to give a measure, but the level of collaboration is excellent and medium, which can be roughly felt.
    Mainly to answer a question: what are the main problems in the current collaboration, and what can be done to significantly improve the level of collaboration

  - Advocate and promote various tasks

    Implement the concept of &quot;collaboration is important&quot; to team members, and promote some measures for employees to switch height to promote collaboration

  - Overall coordination, provision of arbitration

    Collaboration is a dynamic process. There will definitely be differences and frictions among employees in the process of collaboration. Managers should take resolving differences as an opportunity to improve collaborative relationships.
    Resolving differences and contradictions in cooperation is precisely the most effective means to improve the level of cooperation

- Establishment of mechanisms

  Employees don't work well together just because they are proactive, and managers need to provide templates and guidance to avoid confusion and overwhelm.
  How employees should collaborate is not naturally clear, and managers need to establish some mechanisms to guide everyone.

  

- Enhance mutual trust

  - Deep and solid mutual understanding
  - Targeted team building activities
  - Increase opportunities for cooperation and face challenges together

- Keep practicing
