pattern, management is the complexity of a certain requirement, slowly, we will begin to pay attention to domain division, DDD, business modeling, etc., these management is the complexity of the system, and then later, the complexity of things gradually evolved to our personal can not handle, we need teamwork, here is the management of project complexity.</p><p>In fact, these three will exist and are interrelated from beginning to end, and many concepts are similar, but we need to gradually participate in the actual work to realize this complexity step by step.</p><p>Regarding Design pattern and domain-driven design, my previous blogs have summarized some of the books and specific practices I have read. This time, combined with my personal experience and the book “Knowledge and Action”, I will summarize some methodologies in project management…</p><span id="more"></span><p>Let’s talk about some of my biggest takeaways from the book:</p><ol><li>Role recognition is very important. If you don’t realize that you are already a manager, then you won’t recognize what managers should do. Instead, you will compete with team members, not doing what you should do, and letting others do it. Family has nothing to do.</li><li>The system is very important. Don’t shout slogans for culture, values, etc. If you want team members to do something, you must let the system reward this behavior. If you don’t want team members to do something, you must let the system punish this behavior.</li><li>Identifying the work content of team members is what managers should do. If you don’t know what your members are doing, don’t be a manager. It means that you haven’t recognized yourself as a manager.</li><li>Material rewards may not be effective beyond a certain level, but if the material rewards are not in place, the lethality is the greatest.</li><li>The implementation of any system has a cost, such as time cost, Opportunity Cost, do not copy all systems</li><li>For knowledge-creating teams, the lower limit is guaranteed by processes or automation tools, and the upper limit depends on people. Many teams are reversed, and people are guaranteed the lower limit by punishing people by the system. It is necessary to hand over repetitive work to automated processes and free people to do creative work.</li><li>There is no good or bad management tools. Your team needs to execute efficiently and does not need to create much. Then KPI. If you need to create a line, then OKR. Note that what is said here is the spirit of the two tools. There are also many people who use OKR as KPI. tuan</li><li>Team culture is very important, but it is also important whether the team culture you imagine is the same as what you have shaped. At the same time, it is also necessary to recognize that the quality of different aspects of people is Normal Distribution. Don’t expect people under your command to be inherently efficient and collaborative, what’s the use of managers.</li></ol><h2 id="manage-the-hesitation-of-the-intersection"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#manage-the-hesitation-of-the-intersection"></a> Manage the hesitation of the intersection</h2><h3 id="what-are-the-development-paths-for-engineers"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#what-are-the-development-paths-for-engineers"></a> What are the development paths for engineers?</h3><ul><li><p>Technical category</p><ul><li>Architect</li><li>Technical experts</li></ul></li><li><p>Management category</p><ul><li>Technical Manager</li><li>Professional manager</li></ul></li><li><p>Entrepreneurship</p><ul><li>Founder</li><li>Technical partner</li></ul></li><li><p>Consultants</p><ul><li>Investment advisor</li><li>Management consultants</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="who-is-likely-to-enter-management-positions"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#who-is-likely-to-enter-management-positions"></a> Who is likely to enter management positions?</h3><ul><li><p>Time of day</p><p>It is best to go to those fast-growing industries and companies.

This kind of start-up company is more suitable for the direction of technical partners rather than technical managers. Don’t always change companies, because it is not good for improving management ability, because most of the time you are doing the same level of repetition.</p></li><li><p>Geographical location</p><p>It is their own strengths, abilities and the work content they are responsible for<br> The first category is the module responsible for the overall situation, and the core is “wide”.<br> The second category is responsible for the core technical modules, the core is “deep”</p></li><li><p>People and</p><p>The key to people is whether they can get the support of others</p><ol><li>Opportunities.

Its essence is not “knowledge”, but “action”. Its verification does not lie in logic, but in results. Its sole authority is “achievement”.

There are three elements hidden behind this: “people”, “process”, and “effectiveness.” In formal terms, it is called organization, process, and direction</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Management is roughly divided into three stages, corresponding to three different eras</p><p>Focus on the Process: Emphasize how things are done</p><p>Industrial production era: In the early industrial era, the business model with the typical characteristics of the assembly line, “standardization” and “doing things according to the rules” are the most important work values, and any employee’s initiative to innovate may cause great damage to the assembly line, so the focus of management is on the “process”, emphasizing doing things</p><ul><li><p>Focus on process and goals: emphasis on setting goals and achieving them by mastering how to “do things”</p><p>Industrial competition era: In the middle and late industrial era, as competition became more and more fierce, when production itself could not bring significant competitive advantages, managers began to consider how to make production more “effective”, that is, to produce more performance, so more and more Attention is paid to the purpose of production. In addition to continuing to emphasize “doing things”, management also emphasizes “doing things for what”, that is, “goals”</p></li><li><p>Focus on team, process, and goals: emphasis on setting “goals” and achieving them by mastering how to “lead people” and how to “do things”</p><p>The era of knowledge economy: After the industrial development is more fully developed, the trend of “keeping upright” is becoming more and more obvious, especially after the information industry has brought us to the era of knowledge economy, “creativity” has become the life infra of many enterprises.
